# Binary-Tree
The specifications for this program were determined by the University of Washington. The implementation was executed by myself, except for the NodeData ADT, and the driver file, lab2.cpp, which were provided by the University. This program constructs a custom Binary Tree that stores NodeData. It's default operations for searching and printing, per the requirements, are in-order.
